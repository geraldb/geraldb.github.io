## Trivia Quiz of the Month

Let's generate 8 000 000 000, that is, 8 billion unique punks for everyone on planet earth.

Q: How many ("sprite") attributes do we need? Mission impossible? 
Let's do the math. Anyone? [**Post / discuss your calculations / estimates. Yes, you can.**](https://old.reddit.com/r/CryptoPunksDev/comments/ywtdrt/triva_quiz_8_000_000_000_8bn_humans_on_planet/) 





## Week 45 - Monday, November 7th to Sunday, November 13rd, 2022

**right-click & save this ~"magic formula"~ spritesheet**

~Collect'em all!~  Generate'em all!
I started to download "on-blockchain" artwork layers

etc.
and repackaged all attributes in all-in-one spritesheet images.
Yes, you can! (Re)use the "off-blockchain" (pixel) artwork spritesheets 
to generate any combination using text-to-image prompts.



**Questions? Comments?**

Post them on the [D.I.Y. Punk (Pixel) Art reddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/DIYPunkArt). Thanks.

## Week 43 - Monday, October 24th to Sunday, October 30th, 2022

**learn pixel art (re)org**

It's time (again) for a (github) reorg. 
I moved (almost) all pixel art libraries - in javascript, ruby, go (upcoming via artbase.server), etc. - 
and all pixel art how-tos and quick starter templates 
to the new [**Learn Pixel Art org @ github**](https://github.com/learnpixelart), that is, /learnpixelart.


**quiz mania**

Image generation via text prompts is the latest A.I. craze (e.g. DALL·E 2, Midjourney, et al). 
For fun I started to put together a punk (text prompt-to-image) quiz to "train your memory" 
or to show-off your punk (image) I.Q.  
Can you find the matching punk (image art work) for "Male 1 • Normal Beard • Earring • Mohawk Dark"?   A/B/C/D?   
Try the [**Matt & John's® Ye Olde' Punks Quiz**](https://cryptopunksnotdead.github.io/punks.js/quiz/punks) 
or try the [**1000 More Punks Quiz**](https://cryptopunksnotdead.github.io/punks.js/quiz/morepunks).

Bonus:  Try the [**24px Cool Cats Quiz**](https://learnpixelart.github.io/pixelart.js/quiz/coolcats) 
or the [**28px Bored Apes Quiz**](https://learnpixelart.github.io/pixelart.js/quiz/boredapes) or - yes, you can! - 
put together [**your own quiz**](https://github.com/learnpixelart/pixelart.js).



##  Week 42 - Monday, October 17th to Sunday, October 23rd, 2022

**dollz mania (pixel) art restoration / preservation**

![](https://github.com/dollzmania/dollz.sandbox/raw/master/no1/prepprops/blond135.png)
![](https://github.com/dollzmania/dollz.sandbox/raw/master/no1/prepprops/blond167.png)

![](https://github.com/dollzmania/dollz.sandbox/raw/master/no1/prepprops/blondjerules.png)


Anyone remember dollz mania in the 2000s?   I don't ;-). I guess it was mostly a teenage girl craze - 
but now in 2022 with 24x24 pixel art 
turning into million dollar "fine art"   -
the do-it-yourself (D.I.Y.)  - yes, you can - make your 
own free (pixel) "full body" avatars  ([said to have started in 1997 by The Place](https://dollzmania.neocities.org/history/history-overview.html))
via dragging & dropping  the "props" ontop of each other  -
are putting the (crypto bro) punk pixel "artwork" and movement in a different light. 
Where are the hundred of free d.i.y. punk makers (compared to the dollz makers)? 
Or where are the hundred (or even thousands) of free "props", that is, head props, hair props, 
 tops & capes, dresses, bottoms, shoes & socks, wings, specials, accessories, and on and on
for making your own "fully body" pixel avatars?



Anyways,  I started  restoring and preserving dollz mania (pixel) art.
See the new [**Dollz Mania**](https://github.com/dollzmania) org at github.
The first [**/dollz.sandbox**](https://github.com/dollzmania/dollz.sandbox) repo collects dollz "props" from various collections / sets  (thanks 
to the Internet / Web Archive and the Wayback Machine).
See
[**Dollz №1**](https://github.com/dollzmania/dollz.sandbox/tree/master/no1), 
[**Dollz №2**](https://github.com/dollzmania/dollz.sandbox/tree/master/no2), 
[**Dollz №3**](https://github.com/dollzmania/dollz.sandbox/tree/master/no3), and so on 
for some pixel art "props" samples (what almost has been lost). 
   


##  Week 41 - Monday, October 10th to Sunday, October 16th, 2022

**programming pixelart**

Using the Creating Pixel Art by Gray Wolf @ Khan Academy course I added to the new [**/programming pixelart**](https://github.com/pixelartexchange/pixelart/tree/master/programming-pixelart) 
section a bunch of pixel art samples
incl. mario, black cat, nyan cat, owl (sitting on a branch), and more.

![](https://github.com/pixelartexchange/pixelart/raw/master/programming-pixelart/i/mario.png)
![](https://github.com/pixelartexchange/pixelart/raw/master/programming-pixelart/i/cat.png)
![](https://github.com/pixelartexchange/pixelart/raw/master/programming-pixelart/i/among_us.png)

![](https://github.com/pixelartexchange/pixelart/raw/master/programming-pixelart/i/owl.png)
![](https://github.com/pixelartexchange/pixelart/raw/master/programming-pixelart/i/nyan_cat.png)


**factory of modern orginals (FoMO)**

I added a bunch of text-to-image generators to the [**Factory of Modern Originals (FoMO)**](https://github.com/profilepic/originals)
incl. Cyberpunks, Readymades (Punk 1/1s), Goblins, Smileys, & more.  Yes, you can!
Fab(ricate) your own pixel art originals via text prompts. Example:

     $ fab smiley            # -or-
     $ fab will 3d_glasses   # -or-
     $ fab snoopdogg  vr     # -or-
     $ fab goblin             
     # ...

Tip:  Use the (undocumented) ls/list command to list all registered (built-in) text-to-image generators. Try:

     $ fab ls   # -or-
     $ fab list

Resulting in twenty-one (21) text-to-image generator as of Oct 13th.


**punk me! - skin tones**

For the upcoming "punk me!" image generation gem / library I am putting together
[**free skin tone color palettes**](https://github.com/profilepic/skintone) for easy (re)use in the comma-separated values (.csv) format. 
The first batch include:

ye olde punks  (4 skin tones)  - see [skintone/ye_olde_punks.csv](https://github.com/profilepic/skintone/blob/master/ye_olde_punks.csv) <br> 
![](https://github.com/profilepic/skintone/raw/master/i/ye_olde_punks.png) <br>
dr ellis monk  (10 skin tones)  - see [skintone/dr_ellis_monk.csv](https://github.com/profilepic/skintone/blob/master/dr_ellis_monk.csv) <br>
![](https://github.com/profilepic/skintone/raw/master/i/dr_ellis_monk.png) <br>
punk's not dead  (30 skin tones)  - see [skintone/punks_not_dead.csv](https://github.com/profilepic/skintone/blob/master/punks_not_dead.csv) <br>
![](https://github.com/profilepic/skintone/raw/master/i/punks_not_dead.png)


**readymades (punk 1/1s)**

I updated [**readymades - an image generation gem / library that lets you generate (readymade) punk 1/1s**](https://github.com/profilepic/text-to-image/tree/master/readymades).
Some samples include:   
![](https://github.com/profilepic/text-to-image/raw/master/readymades/i/will.png) ![](https://github.com/profilepic/text-to-image/raw/master/readymades/i/will2.png) ![](https://github.com/profilepic/text-to-image/raw/master/readymades/i/will3.png)

##  Week 40 - Monday, October 3rd to Sunday, October 9th, 2022

**talks**

Wed., October 5th, 2022 - (FREE) Live Meetup 20 min. Talk  - Inside the Billion Dollar $$$ (Crypto) Punk Pixel Heads @ [**Technologieplauscherl LXXVII (Linz, Austria) »**](https://technologieplauscherl.at/77/)

Thank you. Welcoming atmosphere, great D.I.Y. (draft-it-yourself) linzer beer & more at the Technologieplauscherl meetup.  
See the [**Inside the Billion Dollar $$$ (Crypto) Punk Pixel Heads**](https://github.com/cryptopunksnotdead/cryptopunks/tree/master/insidepunks) talk notes to learn more about the pixel punks.



**smileys**

I started putting together [**smileys - a new image generation gem / library that lets you generate smileys**](https://github.com/profilepic/text-to-image/tree/master/smileys) 
in four size variants (with circle diameters of 15px, 16px, 17px & 20px) all placed in a 24x24px canvas.
See the smileys/spritesheet_dia16-24x24px.png for the first attributes (incl. base smileys in green, greener, orange, red, white & yellow 
with or without black outlines).

![](https://github.com/profilepic/text-to-image/raw/master/smileys/config/spritesheet_dia16-24x24.png)

For example, `Smiley::Image.generate( 'Yellow', 'Open', 'Smile')` results in 
![](https://github.com/profilepic/text-to-image/raw/master/smileys/i/smiley1.png)
![](https://github.com/profilepic/text-to-image/raw/master/smileys/i/smiley1b.png)
and `Smiley::Image.generate( 'Greener', 'Shades', 'Grin (Right)' )`
results in
![](https://github.com/profilepic/text-to-image/raw/master/smileys/i/smiley2.png)
![](https://github.com/profilepic/text-to-image/raw/master/smileys/i/smiley2b.png).



**opensea (market data)**

I continued to collect (market) data via the opensea api (using the [**artbase opensea api wrapper**](https://github.com/pixelartexchange/artbase/tree/master/artbase-opensea)) on pixel art collections.
Find more reports that only include punk (pixel art) collections such as [**Top Punk (Pixel Art) Collections By Sales (in Ξ)**](https://github.com/cryptopunksnotdead/punks.market/blob/master/TOP.md)
and [**Trending Punk (Pixel Art) Collections (in 30d/7d/1d Sales Volume)**](https://github.com/cryptopunksnotdead/punks.market/blob/master/TRENDING.md) and some more in the [**/punks.market**](https://github.com/cryptopunksnotdead/punks.market) repo.   Want to see a punk (pixel art) collection added?
Yes, you can. Post a comment to the punk (pixel) art channel.

**punk sandbox / experiments / how-tos**

How to decode "on-blockchain" (pixel art) attributes?  For an example, see the 24px punk ape (yacht club) collection. 
I started to add a [**punkapes/decode**](https://github.com/cryptopunksnotdead/punks.sandbox/blob/master/punkapes/decode.rb) script that saves cut-n-paste bytes / blobs (in the .png format)
queried and returned via the traits_data "on-blockchain" contract function "by-hand" 
to "off-blockchain" images for easy (re)use.  



##  Week 39 - Monday, September 26th to Sunday, October 2nd, 2022

**artbase**

I started to add a new (global) artbase collection index / registry, that is, 
[**collections.csv**](https://github.com/pixelartexchange/artbase/blob/master/collections.csv).  The idea is to share 
known ("built-in") ready-to-use artbase collection configurations / setups  incl. Goblin Town,  Pudgy Penguins, Galactic Aliens, Unfudables, Bears, & many more.

**opensea (market data)**

I started to collect (market) data via the opensea api  (using the [**artbase opensea api wrapper**](https://github.com/pixelartexchange/artbase/tree/master/artbase-opensea)) on pixel art collections.
See the new [**/opensea.cache**](https://github.com/pixelartexchange/opensea.cache) repository that holds the cached datasets, scripts
and some first reports such as [**Top (Ethereum) Pixel Art Collections By Sales**](https://github.com/pixelartexchange/opensea.cache/blob/master/ethereum/TOP.md)
and [**Top (OpenSea OpenStore) Pixel Art Collections By Sales**](https://github.com/pixelartexchange/opensea.cache/blob/master/openstore/TOP.md) and some more.


**ruby lang**

I started an open public [**"great" debate / discussion on ruby enums**](https://github.com/joeldrapper/literal_enums/discussions/3).  Join us. 


##  Week 38 - Monday, September 19th to Sunday, September 25th, 2022

**talks**

Wed., September 21st, 2022 - (FREE) Live Meetup 20 min. Talk  - Inside Punkbase - SQLite (SQL.js) In Action @ [**Stahlstadt.js (Linz, Austria) »**](https://www.meetup.com/stahlstadt-js/events/288247775/)

Thank you. Welcoming atmosphere, great oktoberfest (augustiner) beer and questions, & more at the Stahlstadt.js meetup.  
See the [**Inside Punkbase - SQLite (SQL.js) In Action**](https://github.com/cryptopunksnotdead/punkbase/tree/master/insidepunkbase)
talk notes to learn more about Punkbase.


**blockchain research / corruption**

Austria has an "official" Austrian Blockchain Center for Research and according to the website
the researchers (or is it fraudsters?)  are always looking for "Blockchain Researcher (junior or senior)"
and even posting:

> If you haven't found the right job offer here,
> but you are convinced that your skills are a perfect match for ABC Research, 
> then you are welcome to apply for a job at ABC.

Believe it or not - I applied already twice - the first time back in May I got back a (standard) response
that sorry we plan to fill the open position with a women.   Now this crypto winter (or is it this summer?)
I checked back and saw all this new or (fake?) open blockchain positions and applied again and
after no response all August I got an invitation in September for an in-person interview from 9:30 to 11:00h.

While the two all-female secretaries were friendly and welcoming
the interview with the two all-male "researchers" - Klaus Pirklbauer, the blockchain fraudster-in-chief,
and  - Stefan Craß, the no-code blockchain researcher - 
soon went downhill  - I guess talking about open data & open finance and how open source is all about working together (and, yes, researching for the public good) and such didn't really connect and I got practically thrown out after about half an hour (the official time slot was an hour and half)
and two weeks later the email confirmed that we don't want to ever see you again!

For the record - here's my little public blockchain research corner online - [**Blockchain! Blockchain! Blockchain!**](https://github.com/openblockchains) - among many others - 
and here's the million dollar research center - [**Austrian Blockchain Center (ABC)**](https://www.abc-research.at) - with no public code or anything - the best to find is some public discussion / debate 
panel recordings. No warning that blockchain is (mostly) a narrative to scam and fill your own pocket or anything.
Guess what - the Austrian blockchain researcher are top quality (scammers) - and, yes, they pocket the "research" money from the state and
from private companies. Bingo!

Note:  For fairness (I am always happy to be proven wrong) I sent an email to  Klaus Pirklbauer, the blockchain fraudster-in-chief,
and  - Stefan Craß, the no-code blockchain researcher - and the ABC office asking "Where's the (Blockchain) Code?" and to help
with setting the record straight.  Response?  I keep you posted - stay tuned. (Update: Tue Sept/20th) The official response and confirmation is in  and - surprise, surprise - there's no public (blockchain) code online anywhere at best only top-secret private (in-house) code 
and no research on public blockchains only on private permissioned "blockchains" with proof-of-authority better known as "old-school" databases requiring login credentials for updates.   A simulacrum selling itself as Austria's one-stop top state-of-the-art blockchain research center that is in reality without any expertise on public blockchains whatsoever or any public warnings on the ongoing  private permissioned proof-of-authority blockchain scams (still working in 2022!). You have been warned.     

**artbase**

I added a new serve command to the artbase command-line tool
that lets you query art collections in all-in-one single-file SQLite databases (e.g. artbase.db) using a "server-less" web page. Example:

```
$ artserve pudgies          # defaults / auto-completes to pudgies/artbase.db    -or-
$ artserve unemployable     # defautts / auto-completes to unemployable/artbase.db 
$ artserve goblintown       # " "
$ artserve moonbirds        # " " 
$ artserve                  # defaults to ./artbase.db
# ...
```

Note: For now the (artbase) serve command is packaged up in its own "stand-alone" command line tool called `artserve`.
For more see the [**artserve page  »**](https://github.com/pixelartexchange/artbase/tree/master/artserve)  




**moonbirds**

To wrap-up work on the newly published all official 42x42px attributes for the moonbirds by Proof Collective (on github)
I put together an all-in-one spritesheet, that is, spritesheet_v1-42x42.png:

![](https://github.com/pixelartexchange/moonbirds.sandbox/raw/master/moonbirds-official/i/spritesheet_v1-42x42.png)

See the spritesheet in action! I added a new Moonbird V1 image generator to the 
[**moonbirds (image generator) library / gem**](https://github.com/pixelartexchange/pixelart/tree/master/moonbirds).

Moonbirds V1 Trivia (Did You Know?) Aside -  Easter eggs - The official
attributes include about a dozen super-rare never-before-seen (& used)
legendary attributes (eyes, eyewear, headwear) for cosmic, enlightened, & jade moonbirds (incl. a unicorn horn!). 



##  Week 37 - Monday, September 12th to Sunday, September 18th, 2022

**moonbirds**

About a month ago I reported the breaking news story [**Proof's Moonbirds Token Images Officialy Declared Public Domain (No Rights Reserved) under Creative Commons Zero (CC0) Dedication by Kevin Rose (Chief of Proof) - Thank You!**](https://old.reddit.com/r/DIYPunkArt/comments/who4wm/breaking_news_proofs_moonbirds_token_images/) and
this Monday the Proof Collective published all official 42x42px attributes for the moonbirds 
(incl. all legendaries) on github.  To celebrate  I added a copy of the official 200+ attributes in the new /moonbirds-official directory
in the [**moonbirds.sandbox**](https://github.com/pixelartexchange/moonbirds.sandbox).
As a bonus I added a new [**generate_legendary script**](https://github.com/pixelartexchange/moonbirds.sandbox/blob/master/moonbirds-official/generate_legendary.rb) to generate a first small sample batch of  legendary moonbirds (e.g. 
no. 6949 ![](https://github.com/pixelartexchange/moonbirds.sandbox/raw/master/moonbirds-official/i/moonbird6949.png), 
no. 7473 ![](https://github.com/pixelartexchange/moonbirds.sandbox/raw/master/moonbirds-official/i/moonbird7473.png), 
no. 2941 ![](https://github.com/pixelartexchange/moonbirds.sandbox/raw/master/moonbirds-official/i/moonbird2941.png)) from scratch (using the official attributes)  plus I added a new [**generate_10000 script**](https://github.com/pixelartexchange/moonbirds.sandbox/blob/master/moonbirds-official/generate_10000.rb) to (re)generate all 10 000 moonbirds from scratch (using the official attributes and official "unofficial" metadata records that incl. beak color, eyes color, and more NOT present in the official "on-blockchain" token metadata via the official moonbird HTTP API). 


**artbase**

I added a new build command to the artbase comand-line tool / library
that lets you build all-in-one single-file SQLite databases (e.g. artbase.db). Example:

```
$ artbase pudgies build          # or
$ artbase unemployable build   
$ artbase goblintown build
$ artbase moonbirds build
# ...
```

Note: For now the build command REQUIRES a build.rb configuration script that defines the (metadata) columns / schema.
See the build.rb scripts in the [**artbase.sandbox**](https://github.com/pixelartexchange/artbase.sandbox)
or [**moonbirds.sandbox**](https://github.com/pixelartexchange/moonbirds.sandbox) for real-world examples incl. pudgies, unemployable, goblintown, etc.


**artbase.js**

New artbase.js samples include:

[**Moonbirdbase**](https://pixelartexchange.github.io/artbase.js/moonbirdbase/) (10000 max.)  - query moonbird (pixel owl) metadata & images (42×42px) via sql & more - download  all-in-one single-file sqlite database (~9MB)

[**Pudgybase**](https://pixelartexchange.github.io/artbase.js/pudgybase/) (5000 max.) - query pudgy (penguin) metadata & images (28×28px) via sql & more - download all-in-one single-file sqlite database (~5MB)

[**Unemployablebase**](https://pixelartexchange.github.io/artbase.js/unemployablebase/) (5000 max.) - query unemployable metadata & images (24×24px) via sql & more - download all-in-one single-file sqlite database (~2MB)

and more

Note: Yes, the readymade artbase.db for easy download samples are built with the new artbase build machinery (see above).
