h3. Step 0: Install the Facebooker gem

Install the Facebooker gem. Type on the command line:

{{{
$ gem install facebooker
}}}

h3. Step 1: Log on to Facebook and setup your new application

Now that you have the Facebooker gem installed you need to log on to Facebook and set up your new application. Browse to the "Facebook Developers":http://facebook.com/developers page (@facebook.com/developers@) and click "Set Up New Application".

Fill in the new application form:

* Use "Desktop Quick Start" for your Application Name. 
* Check that you have read and agree to the terms of service.
* We build a desktop application (script). Check (X) Desktop for Application Type.

That's all. Hit submit to get your API key and secret created. Write down your API key and secret for the next step.

{{{
API Key: 47013ae80a97cc151707961fc03bc9bf
Secret: 7f296d598f9c79a5f439289e1240dc69
}}}

h3. Step 2: Create your Ruby script (aka Facebook desktop app)

Let's create a simple Ruby script (@status.rb@) that uses the Facebook API to display a Twitter-like "What are you doing?" status message.

{{{
require 'facebooker'

session = Facebooker::Session::Desktop.create( 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE', 'YOUR_SECRET_KEY_HERE' )

puts "Paste the URL into your web browser and login:"
puts session.login_url
puts "Hit return to continue..."
gets

puts "What are you doing?"
puts "#{session.user.name} #{session.user.status.message}"
}}}

Note, you have to replace the placeholders (@YOUR_API_KEY_HERE@, @YOUR_SECRET_KEY_HERE@) with your own API key and secret. That's it.

h3. Step 3: Run your Ruby script

Start up your ruby script (@status.rb@) and follow the instructions:

{{{
>> Paste the URL into your web browser and login:
>> http://www.facebook.com/login.php?api_key=47013ae80a97cc11fc03bc9bf&v=1.0&auth_token=046eb3578c6994f4f82
>> Hit return to continue...
}}}

Once your logged into your Facebook application (in your browser) hit return (in your shell) to let the Ruby script continue:

!/i/facebooker-desktop-access.png!

{{{
>> What are you doing? 
>> Gerald Bauer is going Canadian, eh? geraldbauer.ca and rubybook.ca now live.
}}}

That's it. Voila.

h3. Bonus: What are your friends doing?

Let's find out and ask Facebook.

{{{
friends = session.user.friends!( :name, :status  )
}}}

Get and cache your friends name and status in a single Facebook API request using @users.getInfo@ under the hood and lets print the updates.

{{{
puts "What are your friends doing?"
friends.each do |friend|
  puts "#{friend.name} #{friend.status.message}"
end
}}}

Resulting in:

{{{
>> Rob Bouton is enjoying the new MGMT album. retro stylins, yo.
>> Shane Griffiths so much for fucking redundancy. RAID my ass.
>> Jeff Birley Good night, Interwebs.  No, really, I am going to bed now...
>> Audrey Berti is reconnecting with my fav cousin in Malaysia, and web 2.0 ing him up
