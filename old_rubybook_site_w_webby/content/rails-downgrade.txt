Let's say you try to follow a tutorial or book written for an older version of Rails - lets say Rails 2.0.2 or even Rails 1.2.6. With the "magic" version tag you can "downgrade" Rails to an older version when generating your new project.

h3. Step 1: Check the Rails version installed

Issue the command:

{{{
$ gem list rails
}}}

to check what Rails version you have installed resulting in:

{{{
*** LOCAL GEMS ***

rails (2.1.0, 2.0.2)
}}}

If the older Rails version you want to use is not yet installed on your box you can install it using the @gem@ command with the @--version/-v@ switch. Example:

{{{
$ gem install rails -v 1.2.6
}}}

h3. Step 2: Generate new Rails project with magic version tag to "downgrade" to older version

Let's generate a new Rails project requesting version 2.0.2 using the magic version tag:

{{{
rails _2.0.2_ hola
}}}

And if you want to include a command line switch to use a different database - lets say MySQL - use:

{{{
rails _2.0.2_ -d mysql hola
}}}

That's all there is to it. Note, that the "magic" version tag goes first and requires leading and trailing underscores (_).


h3. Step 3: Check your version

To wrap up you can check that everything is working and setup using the older version by changing to your app folder and running the about script:

{{{
$ cd hola
$ ruby script/about
}}}

Resulting in:

{{{
About your application's environment
Ruby version              1.8.6 (i386-mswin32)
RubyGems version          1.2.0

Environment               development

}}}
