### Puppet Labs SlideKit

Tools for building training, presentation and demo slides.
The SlideKit class provides methods to build a single slide file out fragments stored
in a directory structure.  This slide file can then be converted into
html slides using tools like s9 and s6.
Additionally, there are a few S9 helpers included that we use to help build the slides.
